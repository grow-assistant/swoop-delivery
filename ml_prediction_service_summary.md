# ML Prediction Service Implementation Summary

## Overview
The ML Prediction Service has been successfully implemented to replace random timers and simple logic in the DoorDash-like delivery simulation. The service provides intelligent predictions for order preparation time, travel time, and offer acceptance probability.

## Implementation Details

### 1. PredictionService Class (`src/prediction_service.py`)
A comprehensive service that simulates machine learning models with the following methods:

#### `predict_order_prep_time(order)`
- **Purpose**: Estimates preparation time based on order contents
- **Features**:
  - Base time of 2 minutes per item
  - Complexity factors: simple (0.8x), medium (1.0x), complex (1.5x)
  - Quantity scaling using square root (for bulk efficiency)
  - Random variation (±20%) to simulate real-world conditions
  - Default fallback of 10 minutes for orders without items

#### `predict_travel_time(start_location, end_location, time_of_day)`
- **Purpose**: Estimates travel time between locations
- **Features**:
  - Base travel time of 1.5 minutes per hole
  - Time-of-day traffic patterns:
    - Morning: 0.8x (faster)
    - Noon: 1.2x (slower)
    - Afternoon: 1.0x (normal)
  - Terrain difficulty modeling (holes 10-15 are uphill)
  - Random variation (±10%)
  - Minimum travel time of 0.5 minutes

#### `predict_offer_acceptance_chance(asset, order)`
- **Purpose**: Predicts probability of delivery acceptance
- **Factors considered**:
  - Base acceptance rate: 80%
  - Distance penalty: -5% per hole distance
  - Workload penalty: -10% per active order
  - Zone matching bonus/penalty for beverage carts
  - Order value bonus for high-value orders
- **Returns**: Probability between 0.1 and 1.0

### 2. Enhanced Data Models (`src/models.py`)
- **OrderItem**: New class for order items with:
  - Name, quantity, complexity, and price
- **Order**: Enhanced with:
  - Items list
  - Total value
  - Time of day

### 3. Updated Dispatcher (`src/dispatcher.py`)
- Integrated PredictionService for all time calculations
- Added acceptance probability logic
- Simulates offer rejection based on predicted acceptance chance
- Enhanced output to show prep time and acceptance probability

### 4. Demonstration (`src/main.py`)
- Creates realistic orders with multiple items
- Shows different complexity levels and time periods
- Displays ML model confidence metrics

## Key Improvements Over Previous System

1. **Dynamic Prep Time**: Instead of fixed 10 minutes, prep time now varies based on:
   - Number of items
   - Item complexity
   - Quantity efficiency

2. **Intelligent Travel Time**: Replaces simple distance calculation with:
   - Traffic patterns
   - Terrain considerations
   - Time-of-day variations

3. **Realistic Acceptance Logic**: Assets can now reject offers based on:
   - Distance to pickup
   - Current workload
   - Zone preferences
   - Order value

4. **Model Confidence Tracking**: The system provides transparency about prediction accuracy

## Example Output
The simulation now shows:
- Item-based prep time predictions (e.g., 3.7 min for simple drinks, 7.7 min for complex food)
- Acceptance probabilities (e.g., 80% for nearby orders, 75% for distant ones)
- ML model confidence metrics for each prediction type

## Future Enhancements
The current implementation provides a foundation for:
- Real ML model integration
- Historical data collection
- A/B testing different prediction strategies
- Dynamic model retraining
- Feature engineering for better predictions
